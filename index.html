  <p>My name is Lawrence Agyei and I am a Chicago-based photographer, originally from Ghana. At a young age, I would carry a small digital camera around and take pictures of my friends. It wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I discovered the camera as an artist medium. I decided to become an artist right after high school. Most of my photographs are portraits and streets shots. I love street photography because I like to be in touch with people, I want to learn from their lives and experiences. I like the fact that in the streets, there’s nothing you can actually control, you have to be able to catch in very few seconds a scene, you never know what is going to happen. the street is always innovative, changeable, you can pass by 100 times around the same place and is never the same.</p>
  <p>Creating is the new thing to do. Create your own path, your own future, your own destiny. Don't go with the flow, be the flow.</p>
